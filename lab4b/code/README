*** Contents

  lab4b.c - C source file containing the implementation for sampling of temperature with Grove Sensors on the Beaglebone.
  Makefile - contains directives for building, testing, cleaning, and building a tarball with the source files.
  README - contains descriptions of the contents and assumptions made during implementation of the module.
  smoketest.sh - contains a small script that tests basic behavior of the program.

*** Assumptions/Notes

  Unrecognized arguments exit with code 1.
  Failed system calls exit with code 1.
  The argument for --period is expected to be a positive integer.
  In stdin commands, value for period is expected to be a non-negative integer.

  The buffer size for stdin commands is 512, that means entering excessively long commands without delimiting with '\n'
  leads to undefined behavior.
